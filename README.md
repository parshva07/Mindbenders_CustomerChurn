# Mindbenders_CustomerChurn
Customer churning is a problem being faced by the telecom industry due to various reasons. Hence in order to retain the overall market share we have created a machine learning model which can predict the chances of a customer getting churned. Using the results telecom giants can target these set of customers in order to retain them.
The task is to predict whether a customer will be churning by analyzing historic data.
We took the data from Kaggle which considered of training and testing data but the test data was unlabeled hence we performed a train test split on the training data itself. Data consisted of 4250 rows and 20 columns. Data was clean with no missing values.
Our dependent variable is “churn” which is a categorical Boolean variable with yes and no as values.
